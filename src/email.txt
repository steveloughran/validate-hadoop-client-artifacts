Release notes
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hadoop/${rc.name}/RELEASENOTES.md

There's a very small number of changes, primarily critical code/packaging
issues and security fixes.

* The critical fixes which shipped in the 3.2.3 release.
* CVEs in our code and dependencies
* Shaded client packaging issues.
* A switch from log4j to reload4j

reload4j is an active fork of the log4j 1.17 library with the classes
which contain CVEs removed. Even though hadoop never used those classes,
they regularly raised alerts on security scans and concen from users.
Switching to the forked project allows us to ship a secure logging
framework. It will complicate the builds of downstream
maven/ivy/gradle projects which exclude our log4j artifacts, as they
need to cut the new dependency instead/as well.

See the release notes for details.

This is the second release attempt. It is the same git commit as before, but
fully recompiled with another republish to maven staging, which has bee
verified by building spark, as well as a minimal test project.

Please try the release and vote. The vote will run for 5 days.
