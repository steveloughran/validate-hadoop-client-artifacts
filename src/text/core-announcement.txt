This is a release of Apache Hadoop ${release.branch} line.

Key changes include

* A big update of dependencies to try and keep those reports of
  transitive CVEs under control -both genuine and false positives.
* Critical fix to ABFS input stream prefetching for correct reading.
* Vectored IO API for all FSDataInputStream implementations, with
  high-performance versions for file:// and s3a:// filesystems.
  file:// through java native IO
  s3a:// parallel GET requests.
* Arm64 binaries. Note, because the arm64 release was on a different
  platform, the jar files may not match those of the x86
  release -and therefore the maven artifacts.
* Security fixes in Hadoop's own code.

Users of Apache Hadoop ${previous.version} and earlier should upgrade to
this release.

All users are encouraged to read the [overview of major changes][1]
since release ${previous.version}.

For details of bug fixes, improvements, and other enhancements since
the previous ${previous.version} release, please check [release notes][2]
and [changelog][3].


Azure ABFS: Critical Stream Prefetch Fix
----------------------------------------

The ABFS connector has a critical bug fix
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18546:
*ABFS. Disable purging list of in-progress reads in abfs stream close().*

All users of the abfs connector in hadoop releases 3.3.2+ MUST either upgrade
to this release or disable prefetching by setting
`fs.azure.readaheadqueue.depth` to `0`.
