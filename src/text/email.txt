[VOTE] Release Apache Hadoop ${hadoop.version}
Smoke test release release Apache Hadoop ${hadoop.version}

Mukund and I have put together a release candidate (${rc}) for Hadoop ${hadoop.version}.

This isn't quite ready for a vote as we know there are a couple of fixes to go in
(one for abfs, one for hadoop-hdfs-nfs).

What we would like is for anyone who can to verify the tarballs, especially
anyone who can try the arm64 binaries as we want to include them too.

The RC is available at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hadoop/${rc-dirname}/

The git tag is ${tag.name}, commit ${git.commit.id}

The maven artifacts are staged at
${nexus.staging.url}

You can find my public key at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/hadoop/common/KEYS

Mukund doesn't have one as gpg refuses to work on his laptop.
